            <h2>What is a Coronavirus?</h2>
            <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
                several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="2">
            <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and
                disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="3">
            <h2>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
                and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
                begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
                likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                attention.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="4">
            <h2>How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
            <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person
                through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or
                exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
                by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch
                COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
                This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.</p>
            <p>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                findings.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h3>
            <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with
                respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h3>
            <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The
                risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with
                COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It
                is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does
                not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will
                continue to share updated findings.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</h3>
            <p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial
                investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not
                a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and
                will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean
                hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.</p>

            <h2>What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?</h2>
            <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
            </p>
            <h3>Protection measures for everyone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap
                    and
                    water.</li>
                <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or
                    sneezing.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
                <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
                    your
                    mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used
                    tissue immediately.</li>
                <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                    attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.</li>
                <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is
                    spreading
                    widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have
                    diabetes, heart or lung disease.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19
                is spreading</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for everyone)</li>
                <li>Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as
                    headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is
                    essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a
                    mask to avoid infecting other people.</li>
                <li>If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be
                    due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of
                    any recent travel or contact with travelers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="6">
            <h2>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding
                there.</p>
            <p>For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now
                places
                around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                these
                areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous
                action
                every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on
                travel,
                movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching
                or
                spreading COVID-19.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="7">
            <h2>Should I worry about COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However,
                it
                can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore
                quite
                normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.</p>
            <p>We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First
                and
                foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene.
                Secondly,
                keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in
                place
                on travel, movement and gatherings.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="8">
            <h2>Who is at risk of developing severe illness?</h2>
            <p>While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with
                pre-existing
                medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear
                to
                develop serious illness more often than others.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="9">
            <h2>Are antibiotics effective in prevent or treating COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused
                by a
                virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment
                of
                COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="10">
            <h2>Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19,
                there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend
                self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.
                However,
                there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will
                continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="11">
            <h2>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
                However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
                hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
            <p>Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested
                through
                clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat
                COVID-19.</p>
            <p>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
                hands,
                cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet)
                from
                people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="12">
            <h2>Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</h2>
            <p>No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory
                Syndrome
                (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
            </p>
            <p>SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS
                anywhere in
                the world since 2003.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div id="13">
            <h2>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</h2>
            <p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who
                may
                have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone
                who
                is
                ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use
                masks
                wisely.</p>
            <p>WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use
                of
                masks.</p>
            <p>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
                hands,
                cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet)

                <li>Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.</li>
                <li>Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).</li>
                <li>Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).</li>
                <li>Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the
                    shape
                    of your nose.</li>
                <li>Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.</li>
                <li>After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask
                    away
                    from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.</li>
                <li>Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.</li>
                <li>Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if
                    visibly
                    soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.</li>

            <h2>How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the
                disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around
                five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.</p>

            <h2>Can humans become infected with COVID-19 from an animal source?</h2>
            <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected
                with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with
                civet
                cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet
                been
                confirmed.</p>
            <p>To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and
                surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk
                or
                animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked
                animal products.</p>

            <h2>Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?</h2>
            <p>While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence
                that a
                dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an
                infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and
                thoroughly.

            <h2>How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h2>
            <p>It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave
                like
                other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the
                COVID-19
                virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different
                conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).</p>
            <p>If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect
                yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                Avoid
                touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>

            <h2>Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?</h2>
            <p>Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching
                the
                virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different
                conditions and temperature is also low. </p>

            <h2>Is there anything I should do?</h2>
            <p>The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smoking</li>
                <li>Wearing multiple masks</li>
                <li>Taking antibiotics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk
                of
                developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care
                provider.</p>
