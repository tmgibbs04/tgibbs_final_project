    <!-- I honestly don't know if I have met all the criteria because I feel like we didn't get enough time spent learning about layouts.
    I use a lot of floating elements and have learned a lot about how they work through trial and error.  I also feel like making 
    separate css files for each page was redundant and most of it could have been combined and linked to all the pages, but it was
    getting very confusing doing it that way.  I think if I where to start over fresh on this project I could make it a lot cleaner and
    more organized now that I have learned so much.  Overall I'm happy with the end result. -->

        <h1>Coronavirus</h1>
        <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more
            severe diseases such as <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/">Middle East Respiratory
                Syndrome (MERS-CoV)</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS-CoV)</a>. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in
            humans.</p>
        <p>Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations
            found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.
            Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.</p>
        <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing
            difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney
            failure and even death.</p>
        <p>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose
            when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing
            symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>
        <h2>COVID-19</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html">Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</a>
            is a disease that was identified in Wuhan, China, and is now being spread
            throughout the world. People are encouraged to take common sense precautions to prevent the spread of all
            infectious diseases, including COVID-19.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time.</li>
            <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
            <li>Avoid close contact with people who are ill.</li>
            <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
            <li>Do not reuse tissue after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.</li>
            <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
        <p>Coronaviruses like COVID-19 are most often spread through the air by coughing or sneezing, through close
            personal contact (including touching and shaking hands) or through touching your nose, mouth or eyes before
            washing your hands.</p>
        <h2>Exposure and symptoms</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html">Symptoms</a> of COVID-19 are fever,
            cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.</p>
        <p>If you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms, you may need to seek medical
            attention. <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/county-health-departments">Call your
                local health department</a> for further guidance. Before going to a health care provider,
            clinic, hospital or emergency room, call ahead to describe your symptoms and how you may have been exposed
            to the virus. In the event of an emergency call 9-1-1.</p>
